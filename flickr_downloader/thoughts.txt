Get list of locations from "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_places" by scriping Wikipedia.

OR

Get a list of places by scraping Google Maps locations, a list of all locations.
I remember a guy having his own maps/navigation server setup which was rendering, maybe I can use something like 
that for open data.

"https://wikipedia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code.html"
"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GeoData"
The "wikipedia.geosearch" maybe, check for each meter of latitude and longitude to get list of places.
