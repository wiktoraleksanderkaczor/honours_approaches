# Honours dissertation project

This is the GitHub repository for my honours dissertation project dealing with retrieving accurate camera positions in the GPS datum, assuming they are of a popular landmark, given a dataset with a small subset of accurage GPS image tags. Additionally, it also includes work on semi-automatically gathering such a dataset from the website known as Flickr.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies. This assumes Python 3.8.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Fill in the appropriate details in the "config.py" file and run through the wizard like so;

```bash
python main.py
```
