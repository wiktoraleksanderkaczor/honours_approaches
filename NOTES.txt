- Remember initial pair MUST be good, otherwise, it's the difference between reconstructing the inside or outside of a building.

- How the fuck am I meant to say how accurate it is when the fucking GPS embedded in the images is shit off point. Well, it sure won't be quantitative, but it could be qualitative.

- I have to remember to remove the outliers using GpsPrune, the KMeans only works for the most extreme results.

- Right, since my fun little georegistration problem puts the coordinates of
everything in GPS translation... I can literally just merge the fucking 
sfm_data.json results... say Edinburgh Castle and the Notre Dame...
So long as I can handle the fucking referencing.

-I know this one was georeferenced using only four images, out of the five given... I need to find a way to ensure the images are actually in the reconstruction from the JSON file.
One way of doing so might be checking if their "distro_k3" are NOT all 0.
